### **Matrix of Severity and Priority**  

The **Severity and Priority Matrix** helps testers and developers decide which bugs to fix first.  
- **Severity** = How badly the bug affects the system.  
- **Priority** = How urgently the bug needs to be fixed.  

### **1. High Severity, High Priority (Level 1) â€“ Critical Issue, Needs Immediate Fix**  
- **Explanation:** Bugs in this category cause serious system failures and prevent users from completing important tasks. These must be fixed **immediately**.  
- **Example:** The checkout system on an e-commerce website is broken, preventing customers from buying products.  
- **Impact:** Business operations stop, so fixing this is the **top priority**.  


### **2. High Severity, Low Priority (Level 2) â€“ Major Issue, Can Wait**  
- **Explanation:** These bugs affect the system significantly but are not part of the main process, so they do not require immediate action.  
- **Example:** Users cannot access the product comment section on an e-commerce website.  
- **Impact:** Important but does not stop critical functions, so it can be fixed **later**.  


### **3. Low Severity, High Priority (Level 3) â€“ Minor Issue, Needs Immediate Fix**  
- **Explanation:** These bugs do not affect system functionality but can harm the companyâ€™s reputation, requiring quick resolution.  
- **Example:** The company's logo is displayed incorrectly on the homepage, making the brand look unprofessional.  
- **Impact:** Even though it does not break the system, it affects user trust, so it should be fixed **quickly**.  

### **4. Low Severity, Low Priority (Level 4) â€“ Minor Issue, Can Wait**  
- **Explanation:** These bugs have almost no impact on system functionality or user experience. They can be fixed when time allows.  
- **Example:** A small typo in a rarely visited section of the website.  
- **Impact:** Since it does not affect users or the system, fixing it is **not urgent**.  

### **Why is This Important?**  
- It helps teams **prioritize** bug fixes effectively.  
- Ensures that **critical issues** are handled first.  
- Saves time by delaying **low-priority bugs** that do not affect functionality.  

This matrix ensures a **smooth workflow** in software development and testing! ðŸš€
