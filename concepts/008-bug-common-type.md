## **Common Types of Software Errors with Definitions and Examples**

1. **Functionality Errors**  
   - **Definition:** These occur when a feature does not work as expected.  
   - **Example:** A "Submit" button on a form is not clickable, preventing users from submitting data.  

2. **User Interface (UI) Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Issues related to the appearance and interaction of the software’s interface.  
   - **Example:** Incorrect spelling on a webpage or a misplaced button affecting usability.  

3. **Error Handling Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Errors that occur when a system fails to manage exceptions properly.  
   - **Example:** A login page displays "Unknown error" instead of "Incorrect password."  

4. **Boundary Related Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Errors that occur when software fails to handle input within expected limits.  
   - **Example:** A text field allows users to enter more than the allowed number of characters, causing database overflow.  

5. **Control Flow Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Errors in the logical sequence of operations that affect the execution of a program.  
   - **Example:** Clicking on a "Next" button redirects users to the homepage instead of the next step in a process.  

6. **Calculation Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Issues caused by incorrect mathematical logic or implementation.  
   - **Example:** An e-commerce app incorrectly calculates discounts, charging users more than intended.  

7. **Testing Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Issues in the testing process that prevent proper defect detection.  
   - **Example:** A tester cannot reproduce a reported bug due to inconsistent testing environments.  

8. **Security Errors**  
   - **Definition:** Vulnerabilities that expose software to unauthorized access or attacks.  
   - **Example:** A website allows SQL injection, enabling hackers to retrieve sensitive user data.  

9. **Performance Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Software performs slower than expected due to inefficient code or server issues.  
    - **Example:** A mobile app takes 10 seconds to load a page instead of 2 seconds.  

10. **Concurrency Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Errors caused when multiple processes or threads try to access shared resources simultaneously.  
    - **Example:** Two users trying to book the last available flight seat at the same time, leading to overbooking.  

11. **Compatibility Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Issues where software does not work correctly across different devices, browsers, or operating systems.  
    - **Example:** A website that functions well on Chrome but breaks on Safari due to CSS differences.  

12. **Configuration Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Problems caused by incorrect setup or deployment settings.  
    - **Example:** A web application crashes because of missing database connection parameters in the production environment.  

13. **Localization Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Issues that occur when software is not properly adapted for different regions or languages.  
    - **Example:** A currency symbol ($) is not changed to (€) when switching from the U.S. to the European version of an app.  

14. **Data Handling Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Problems that occur when processing, storing, or retrieving data.  
    - **Example:** A banking app displays incorrect transaction details due to database corruption.  

15. **Hardware or Device Compatibility Errors**  
    - **Definition:** Errors that arise when software does not function properly with specific hardware components.  
    - **Example:** A mobile game crashes on certain smartphone models due to GPU incompatibility.
