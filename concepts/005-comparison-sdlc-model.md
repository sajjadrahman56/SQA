### **Comparison of SDLC Models**

| SDLC Model | Explanation | Best For | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Waterfall Model** | A sequential model where each phase (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. | **Small projects with well-defined requirements.** | - Simple and easy to manage. <br> - Well-documented process. | - Not flexible (hard to change requirements). <br> - Late testing (bugs detected at the end). |
| **V-Model (Verification & Validation)** | An extension of Waterfall where each development phase has a corresponding testing phase. | **Projects with strict quality control.** | - Early defect detection. <br> - Clear structure for testing. | - No flexibility for changing requirements. <br> - Expensive for complex projects. |
| **Incremental Model** | The software is developed in **small increments**, and each increment is tested before adding new functionality. | **Medium to large projects with evolving requirements.** | - Allows gradual improvements. <br> - Easier testing and debugging. | - Requires proper planning. <br> - Integration issues can arise. |
| **Agile Model** | Focuses on **iterative development** with frequent releases and continuous customer feedback (Scrum, Kanban, XP). | **Projects with changing requirements.** | - Flexible and adaptive. <br> - Continuous testing and user involvement. | - Needs experienced teams. <br> - Difficult to manage for fixed-budget projects. |
| **Scrum (Agile Framework)** | An Agile framework where work is divided into short **Sprints (2-4 weeks)**, and teams work collaboratively. | **Dynamic and evolving projects.** | - Quick delivery of functional parts. <br> - Continuous customer feedback. | - Requires dedicated team members. <br> - May lack documentation. |
| **Spiral Model** | Combines iterative development with risk management. The project is divided into cycles, and risks are assessed at each stage. | **High-risk and complex projects.** | - Risk management is built-in. <br> - Flexible for requirement changes. | - Expensive and time-consuming. <br> - Needs expert risk analysis. |
| **Big Bang Model** | No structured planning; all development happens without formal phases. | **Small and experimental projects.** | - Simple and requires no planning. | - Highly risky. <br> - Not suitable for large projects. |
| **Prototype Model** | A working prototype is created first to understand user needs before final development. | **Projects with unclear requirements.** | - Helps get early user feedback. <br> - Reduces misunderstandings. | - Can increase development cost. <br> - Extra effort required to create prototypes. |

### **Key Takeaways:**
- If **requirements are fixed** → Use **Waterfall or V-Model**.
- If **requirements are likely to change** → Use **Agile, Scrum, or Prototype**.
- If **quality assurance is critical** → Use **V-Model**.
- If **risk is high** → Use **Spiral Model**.
- If **time is limited** → Use **Incremental or Agile**
