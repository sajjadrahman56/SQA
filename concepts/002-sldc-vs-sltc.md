# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

### 1. **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The **SDLC** is a **step-by-step process** that guides the development of software from the initial idea to its release and beyond. It ensures that the software is well-planned, developed, tested, and maintained systematically.

#### **Phases of SDLC:**

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: The project’s goals are defined, and high-level planning is done to ensure the project aligns with the business needs.
   - **Example**: A company decides to create a food delivery app. In the planning phase, they determine what features they want (like user login, order tracking, payment integration), identify the risks (such as security breaches), and clarify the project’s scope.
  
2. **Requirements Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: This phase focuses on gathering and analyzing the requirements of the software. What exactly does the software need to do? What should the end-users be able to accomplish?
   - **Example**: The team discusses specific details, such as "users should be able to filter restaurants by cuisine" or "the app should work on both iOS and Android devices."

3. **Design Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: The software architecture and design are created. This includes designing the database, user interface (UI), and overall software structure.
   - **Example**: The team designs how the app will look (UI design), how the data will be stored (database design), and how different components will interact (system design).

4. **Implementation (Coding) Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: Developers write the actual code for the software based on the design.
   - **Example**: Developers start coding the food delivery app, creating user profiles, adding the ability to place orders, integrating payment systems, etc.

5. **Testing Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: The software is tested for bugs, defects, and any other issues. Testers ensure that the code meets the requirements and that the system works as expected.
   - **Example**: Testers simulate different scenarios like a user placing an order or tracking delivery. They look for bugs such as the app crashing or payments not processing.

6. **Deployment Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: The software is released to the users or the market.
   - **Example**: The food delivery app is made available for download on the App Store and Google Play. Developers monitor the app’s performance post-launch.

7. **Maintenance Phase**:
   - **What Happens**: After deployment, the software must be maintained. This includes fixing bugs that users report and updating the software with new features.
   - **Example**: If users report issues with the payment system or request a new feature, like adding a “tip the driver” option, the team updates the app accordingly.


### 2. **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**

The **STLC** is a **set of stages** dedicated specifically to **testing** software. While it’s a part of the SDLC, it focuses solely on testing and ensuring the quality of the software before it goes live.

#### **Phases of STLC:**

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - **What Happens**: Testers review the requirements to identify what needs to be tested. They make sure the requirements are clear, testable, and complete.
   - **Example**: The testers review the requirements for the food delivery app and check if there are any gaps, like "Does the app specify how many types of payments should be accepted?"

2. **Test Planning**:
   - **What Happens**: A testing strategy is created. This includes defining the scope of testing, selecting tools, and estimating resources and timelines.
   - **Example**: The team decides they’ll test on different devices (iPhones, Android phones), estimate how long testing will take, and assign testers to each part of the app.

3. **Test Case Development**:
   - **What Happens**: Test cases are written. Test cases describe step-by-step instructions on how to test specific features.
   - **Example**: For the "order food" feature, a test case might say: "Open the app, select a restaurant, choose a dish, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout." Expected results would be clearly defined too, like "the payment page should display the correct total."

4. **Test Environment Setup**:
   - **What Happens**: The environment where the tests will be run is set up. This could include setting up test servers, installing the required software, and preparing test data.
   - **Example**: The testers set up the app on different versions of iOS and Android to check how it behaves in different environments.

5. **Test Execution**:
   - **What Happens**: The test cases are executed. Testers run the tests and compare actual results with expected results. If any issues are found, they are reported.
   - **Example**: Testers try placing an order and compare the results (order gets placed or app crashes). If they find a bug (like the app crashing), they report it to the developers.

6. **Test Closure**:
   - **What Happens**: Once testing is complete, the results are documented. Testers evaluate whether all the planned tests were run, and any unresolved bugs are recorded.
   - **Example**: The testing team checks if all the critical tests have passed, and they prepare a final report, noting any remaining bugs that need to be addressed later.


### **SDLC vs. STLC**
While both are essential to software development, they serve different purposes:

- **SDLC** covers the **entire lifecycle** of software development, from planning to maintenance. It’s focused on the big picture, guiding how software is conceived, built, and maintained.
  
- **STLC** focuses **only on the testing process**, ensuring that the product being built in the SDLC is of high quality and meets the requirements before it is released.

### **Example of Interaction:**
1. In the **SDLC**, during the **requirements phase**, developers and stakeholders decide what the app should do.
2. In the **STLC**, during the **requirement analysis phase**, testers check if those requirements can be tested effectively, such as ensuring the app works well when ordering food.
