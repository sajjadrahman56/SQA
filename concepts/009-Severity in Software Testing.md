# **Severity in Software Testing (Easy Explanation)**  

**What is Severity?**  
Severity measures how much a bug affects the software. It tells us how serious the problem is and how much it disrupts the system or user experience.  

There are **four levels** of severity:  

### **1. Critical (S1) – Very Serious**  
   - **What it means:** The software is completely unusable. This type of bug stops the system from working.  
   - **Example:** The app crashes immediately when you open it, making it impossible to use.  
   - **Impact:** No workaround exists, meaning there’s no temporary fix. Developers must solve it immediately.  


### **2. Major (S2) – Serious but Can be Fixed**  
  - **What it means:** The system crashes or a major feature does not work, but some parts of the software still function.  
  - **Example:** A banking app allows users to check their balance, but they cannot transfer money.  
  - **Impact:** A workaround (temporary fix) is possible but difficult to use. It needs urgent attention.  


### **3. Minor (S3) – Small Problem**  
  - **What it means:** The bug affects less important functions but does not stop the main software from working.  
  - **Example:** A shopping app works fine, but the product images take too long to load.  
  - **Impact:** There is an easy workaround, meaning users can still complete their tasks without much trouble.  


### **4. Trivial (S4) – Very Small Issue**  
  - **What it means:** The problem is only related to design or appearance and does not affect how the software works.  
  - **Example:** A spelling mistake on a website or a button color not matching the design theme.  
  - **Impact:** It does not affect software performance, so it is the lowest priority for fixing.  


### **Why is Severity Important?**  
  - It helps testers and developers **prioritize** which bugs need to be fixed first.  
  - Critical and Major bugs need **immediate attention**, while Minor and Trivial bugs can be fixed later.  
  - It ensures that the **most important issues** are fixed before software is released to users.
