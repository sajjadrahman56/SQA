### **Priority in Software Testing**  

**What is Priority?**  
Priority determines **how quickly** a bug needs to be fixed based on how much it affects users or clients. It helps testers and developers decide which bugs to fix **first** when there are multiple issues.  

---

### **1. High Priority – Needs Immediate Fixing**  
- **Definition:** Bugs that seriously affect users or business functions. These must be fixed immediately.  
- **Example:** The payment gateway of an e-commerce website is not working, preventing customers from making purchases.  
- **Impact:** Affects business revenue or user experience, so it is fixed **as soon as possible**.  

---

### **2. Medium Priority – Should Be Fixed Soon**  
- **Definition:** Bugs that cause inconvenience but do not completely stop the software from working.  
- **Example:** A login page is taking longer than usual to load, but users can still log in.  
- **Impact:** It does not stop the system, but it affects usability, so it should be fixed **after high-priority issues**.  

---

### **3. Low Priority – Can Be Fixed Later**  
- **Definition:** Minor bugs that do not affect functionality and can be fixed in future updates.  
- **Example:** A misspelled word in a message or a slightly misaligned button on a webpage.  
- **Impact:** It does not affect how the system works, so it is **fixed last or during maintenance updates**.

### **Difference Between Severity and Priority:**  
- **Severity** is about how serious the bug is for the software.  
- **Priority** is about how fast the bug needs to be fixed based on user impact.  

**Example:**  
- A **critical security flaw** (Severity: High, Priority: High) needs immediate fixing.  
- A **spelling mistake** in a help section (Severity: Low, Priority: Low) can be fixed later.
